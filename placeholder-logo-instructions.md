# Logo Placement Instructions

To add the ogdrip logo to your application:

1. Place the `ogdrip_logo.webp` file in the `frontend/public/images/` directory.

2. This logo will be automatically displayed in the header as configured in the layout.

3. The current configuration expects a WebP image. If you have a different format (like PNG or JPG), you can:
   - Either convert your image to WebP format
   - Or update the reference in `frontend/src/layouts/Layout.astro` to match your file format

For best results, the logo should be at least 50px in width with a transparent background.
